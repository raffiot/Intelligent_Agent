\begin_layout Plain Layout

% - do you consider the probability distribution of the tasks in defining
 your strategy? How do you speculate about the future tasks that might be
 auctions?

% - how do you combine all the information from the probability distribution
 of the tasks, the history and the planner to compute bids?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our bidding strategy is defined mainly in the function askPrice, helped
 by actionResult and some others auxiliary functions.
 Starting by askPrice function, where we return our best bid for a certain
 task, first thing we do is to compute the bid price based on certain parameters
 except the ones that includes the opponent.
 So for this, we create the initial bid based on the marginal cost, which
 is, the minimum reward we need for having benefit zero.
 After having this 
\emph on
initialBid
\emph default
, we apply over it some factors to improve it, one based on the probability
 distribution of the tasks and another one based on the weight of the task.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
probabilityFactor:
\emph default
 we check how popular are the cities that are going to be introduced in
 the path to take and then delivery the task, the more probability of new
 tasks the more that taking the task worth.
 So, if the probability of having new tasks is high we apply up to a 15%
 of reduction of our bid, on the other side, if probability is low we can
 increment our bid price up to a 15%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
factorCapacity:
\emph default
 if the weight of the task is big compared with mean of our vehicle capacity
 it doesn’t worth taking the task because it will probably penalize us in
 a future, as we won’t be able to carry many in the same time, so we tend
 to penalize heavy tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we have the total factor we apply it to the initial bid and then, we
 try to use all information we have from the opponents to improve even more
 our bid.
 Because of not having enough information, only for the first iteration
 our bid is not modified by the opponents, next iterations do.
 Until task ten we compute what we think that approximately is going to
 be our opponents bid for everyone, then only for the best three opponents,
 which are the ones that have won more tasks.
 To compute their plans, we imagine a model where they only have one vehicle
 and we estimate its initial city by their bid for the first task.
 We create a fictive vehicle for them with our data and this departure city
 and on every iteration we compute their best plans if they take the task.
 With this we get the best possible bid of the opponent and if the difference
 between this bid and our is less than a 5% we return our bid as a 95% of
 the previous, else, if we see that our bid is really good and that opponents
 are far from us we make it greater (a 5%) so that we can earn more money
 with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It’s important to know that for computing the best plan, we reuse the SLS
 algorithm we created for the previous assignment with small changes, such
 that the initial solution for every new task is the previous best solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This was the 
\emph on
askPrice
\emph default
 function, for 
\emph on
actionResult
\emph default
, what we do is to add the task to the plan of the winner so that after
 we can compute the plan in the 
\emph on
askPrice
\emph default
 function.
 Also, as we explained before, for the first iteration, based on the opponents
 bid, we create their fictive initial plan.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summarizing, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We compute our initial bid based on the marginal cost for this bid in our
 plan by using the SLS algorithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We use probability distribution to improve o penalize bids as we prefer
 taking the ones that leads us other tasks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We compute and save the plan that we think others are doing by using the
 bid winners and also, for the first iteration, every bid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We have defined how much we think each situation must affect the bid so
 we combine this into a multiply factor and then we multiply initial bid
 with this factor.

% in this experiment you observe how the results depends on the number of
 tasks auctioned.
 You compare with some dummy agents and potentially several versions of
 your agent (with different internal parameter values).

\end_layout

\end_inset

We run the experiment against a dummy agent, in Switzerland and with 15
 tasks.
 Both agents have the same two vehicles, same capacity and starting city
 - Lausanne and Bern-.

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Plain Layout

% you describe the experimental results and the conclusions you inferred
 from these results
\end_layout

\end_inset

Results shows taht our agent take 14 while the dummy agent 1, we do it with
 a profit of 289 and the other agent 270, so we won this first round.

 internal parameter values)
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We run this experiment with the same configuration as the previous one but
 modifying one of our parameters, the maximun 
\emph on
probabilityFactyor
\emph default
, which goes from 0,05 to 0,15, so, because of this, our bids will tend
 to be greater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Result shows that in this situation we win all of the tasks, so for us is
 15 and for the dummy agent 0.
 Because of this, reward for the opponent is 0, while our is 2343.
 Comparing this with the previous experiment we can see that the 
\emph on
total reward
\emph default
 is 2343 instead of 559, so for this round we have won all bids but also
 got a better profit, as supposed.
 This represents the method we have followed for our bid plan, which is
 taking too many tasks with a really small bid and not leting the opponent
 take any.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Setting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We repeat the same experiment, the 2.1, but this time changing the 
\emph on
capacityFactor
\emph default
 from 0,3 to 0,6 for maximun value, as before, it will make our bids greater.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this observation, we see some results similar to the previous ones,
 much bigger bids, and rewards.
 For us, total profit is 1824, for dummy, 654, total reward is 2478, this
 time total reward is bigger but we get less benefits.
 Strategy is using higher values for our bids but, as before, as we think
 that opponents will tend to use small bids we will submit our experiment
 with greater values than before starting this experiment report.
 Max value for 
\emph on
capacityFactor
\emph default
 is going to be 0,3 while for 
\emph on
probabilityFactor
\emph default
 0,08, so that our bids are bigger but we think that small enought for betting
 other intelligent agents.
